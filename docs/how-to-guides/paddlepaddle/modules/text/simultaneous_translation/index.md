> Simultaneous interpretation, that is, translation before the sentence is completed, the goal of simultaneous interpretation is to automate simultaneous interpretation, which can be translated at the same time as the source language, with a delay of only a few seconds.

:fontawesome-regular-face-laugh-wink: Let's try it out now


## Prerequisite

### 1、environment dependent

Please visit [dependencies](../../../dependencies/)

### 2、transformer_nist_wait_1 dependent

  - paddlepaddle >= 2.1.0

  - paddlehub >= 2.1.0

### 3、Download the model

```bash
hub install transformer_nist_wait_1
```


## Serve the Model

### Install Pinferencia

First, let's install [Pinferencia](https://github.com/underneathall/pinferencia).

```bash
pip install "pinferencia[streamlit]"
```

### Create app.py

Let's save our predict function into a file `app.py` and add some lines to register it.

```python title="app.py" linenums="1"
import paddlehub as hub

from pinferencia import Server

simultaneous_translation = hub.Module(name="transformer_nist_wait_1")


def predict(text: list):
    for t in text:
        print(f"input: {t}")
        result = simultaneous_translation.translate(t)
        print(f"model output: {result}")


service = Server()
service.register(model_name="simultaneous_translation", model=predict)

```


Run the service, and wait for it to load the model and start the server:
<div class="termy">

```console
$ uvicorn app:service --reload
INFO:     Started server process [xxxxx]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

</div>


### Test the service

=== "curl"

    **Request**
