# What's Next

Well, I bet you had some fun with the PyTorch MNIST model in the previous tutorial.

I think you are familiar with **Pinferencia** now.

**Pinferencia** can serve any callable object in a very straight-forward way. No complications.

And it's easy to integrate with your existing codes.

That is what **Pinferencia** is designed for. **Minimum codes modifications**.

Now you can serve models from **any framework**, and you can even **mix up them together**. You can have an API using **different models** from **different frameworks** at the **same time**!

Enjoy yourself!

If you like **Pinferencia**, don't forget to go to [Github](https://github.com/underneathall/pinferencia) and give a star. Thank you.

If you want to explore more examples on different machine learning models, you can find the inside the **Example** section from the navigation panel on your left.
